# jenkins-provisioning-pipe
# Designed a modular Jenkins pipeline for secure cloud provisioning, app deployment, and automated testing using Terraform, SSH, and Slack notifications

This project implements a fully automated, **Terraform-driven CI/CD pipeline** for provisioning infrastructure, deploying and configuring applications, running tests, and delivering real-time feedback via Slack — all orchestrated through **Jenkins**. It demonstrates **best practices in Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **secure remote management**, and **continuous delivery workflows**.

## 🚀 Overview

The pipeline enables teams to:

* **Provision cloud infrastructure** using Terraform.
* **Deploy and configure applications** remotely via SSH.
* **Run automated tests** to validate deployments.
* **Receive instant Slack notifications** for operational awareness.
* Maintain a **clean, repeatable, and parameterised** deployment process.

It’s designed to be **flexible** — allowing you to run only the stages you need, from full deployment to targeted tasks like code validation or infrastructure teardown.


## 🔑 Key Features

1. **Flexible Deployment Options**

   * Controlled via the `DEPLOY_OPTIONS` parameter to separate concerns:

     * `ALL` – Full pipeline (infra + apps)
     * `INFRA` – Terraform plan and apply only
     * `APPS` – Deploy and configure applications only
     * `FMTVAL` – Format and validate Terraform code
     * `DEL` – Destroy infrastructure

2. **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**

   * Initialises Terraform in the `dev` directory.
   * Formats and validates Terraform files for style and syntax.
   * Plans and applies infrastructure with defined variables (e.g., `node1=Nginx`, `node2=Pynode`).
   * Supports clean and complete infrastructure teardown.

3. **Application Deployment & Management**

   * Retrieves Terraform outputs (e.g., EC2 instance DNS names).
   * Connects securely to nodes via Jenkins-managed SSH keys.
   * Installs **Nginx** and **Python3**, configures Nginx to listen on port `8080`.
   * Deploys Python application code to the Python node.

4. **Automated Testing**

   * Executes `pytest` remotely on the Python node to verify application functionality.

5. **Real-Time Slack Notifications**

   * Sends build success or failure updates to a Slack channel.
   * Provides quick operational visibility for the team.

6. **Post-Build Workspace Cleanup**

   * Always cleans the Jenkins workspace after a build to prevent artefact contamination in future runs.



## 📦 Prerequisites

To run this pipeline, ensure the following:

* **Jenkins** instance with:

  * AWS credentials: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` & `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  * SSH private key: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` (for remote EC2 access)
  * Slack API token: `SLACK_TOKEN`
* **Terraform** installed on the Jenkins agent.
* **AWS EC2 instances** accessible via SSH.



## ⚙️ Usage

1. In Jenkins, trigger the pipeline and select the desired `DEPLOY_OPTIONS`.
2. Monitor the console output for detailed stage logs.
3. View your Slack channel for instant deployment status updates.



## 📋 Pipeline Stages

1. **Initialise Terraform**
2. **Format & Validate Terraform Code** (`FMTVAL`)
3. **Plan & Apply Infrastructure** (`INFRA` or `ALL`)
4. **Destroy Infrastructure** (`DEL`)
5. **Deploy & Configure Applications** (`APPS` or `ALL`)
6. **Modify Nginx Port to 8080**
7. **Run Remote Tests with pytest**
8. **Send Slack Notifications**
9. **Clean Jenkins Workspace**

## 🛠 Best Practices Demonstrated

* **Separation of Concerns** via parameterised execution.
* **Infrastructure as Code** for reproducibility and version control.
* **Secure Credential Management** with Jenkins secrets.
* **Automated Testing** to catch issues early.
* **Continuous Feedback Loops** via Slack.
* **Environment Hygiene** through post-build cleanup.

# 🛠️ Jenkins Provisioning Pipeline for Secure Cloud Automation and Remote App Deployment

## 📌 Project Summary

This project showcases a modular Jenkins pipeline designed for secure cloud provisioning, remote application deployment, and automated testing using **Terraform**, **SSH**, and **Slack notifications**. It demonstrates how Infrastructure as Code (IaC), CI/CD automation, and real-time feedback can be orchestrated to deliver scalable and maintainable cloud-native solutions.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- **Modular Pipeline Design**  
  Built with six core stages:  
  1. Terraform Initialisation  
  2. Terraform Format & Validate  
  3. Terraform Plan  
  4. Terraform Apply  
  5. Nginx Installation  
  6. Python Installation  

- **Parameterised Execution via Jenkins UI**  
  Enables selective control of pipeline actions using `DEPLOY_OPTIONS`:
  - `apply` – Provision infrastructure and deploy apps  
  - `destroy` – Tear down infrastructure  
  - `ALL`, `INFRA`, `APPS`, `FMTVAL`, `DEL` – Enforce Separation of Concerns (SoC)

- **Secure Credential Management**  
  - AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) injected via Jenkins UI  
  - SSH private key (`SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`) configured for remote EC2 access  
  - Slack token (`SLACK_TOKEN`) used for notification delivery

- **Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform**  
  - Terraform configuration stored in the `dev` folder  
  - Provisions two EC2 instances:  
    - Node 1: Nginx  
    - Node 2: Python (Pynode)  
  - Outputs DNS values for remote access  
  - Supports destroy operation for resource cleanup

- **Application Deployment via SSH**  
  - Installs and configures Nginx and Python remotely  
  - Replaces Nginx config to listen on port 8080  
  - Deploys a Python script (`hello.py`) to `/tmp` on Pynode

- **Automated Testing**  
  - Executes `pytest` on the Python node to validate deployment  
  - Pipeline fails on test errors to ensure reliability

- **Slack Notifications**  
  - Sends success or failure messages to `devops-masterclass-2024` channel  
  - Uses secure token authentication  
  - Improves visibility and team communication

- **Post-Build Workspace Cleanup**  
  - Utilises Jenkins Workspace Cleanup plugin  
  - Ensures clean environment for future builds
